Date:   Mon Jan 22 17:57:13 2018 +0800
    Added the ability to update middleware

Date:   Mon Jan 22 17:54:36 2018 +0800
    Removing test.js and adding update-script

Date:   Mon Jan 22 10:46:39 2018 +0800
    Added code for ping check. Customer also requested to have the entire domain name present for the user, since Palo Alto requires this. Sends the Palo Alto notification when the mac is already present for this user.

Date:   Mon Jan 22 10:37:25 2018 +0800
    Fix for ping check, deletion of old mac and addition of a new one. The old one still gets an IP as it was not cleared from the allowedmacs pool. We now remove a mac from the pool during unlink for all cases
